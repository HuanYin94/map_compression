# To learn what is useful in a 3D map

1. mapAccuLaser: 	accumalte laser-based experience map

2. mapCheck: 		just show the map

3. mapCompresser:		compress the map according to the saliency descriptor

5. mapAccuLaserMultiple: 	accumalte laser-based experience map, with no-limit Maxsession

6. mapSessioner: 	adjust the session descriptor of some points, data preprocessing, not used

7. mapAccuLaserRange:		accumalte laser-based experience map, consider the range distance

8. labelLaser:		label the points with session in a laser Frame according the map_session_cnt // not used

9. sessionFilter:	make great session be salient! & brother_cnt to filter some lonely ones //salient GET

12.saveAllCRFFeatures:		save all features for simple classification

13.randomSampleMap:			random sampling the map for comparison

14.loadFinalResults:		load the detection results

16.mapCutterTraj: 	cut the wholemap to two parts: train & test, according to the poses attached

17.errorDistribution:		save the NN matched distance between the salient points and salient results

18.DBSCANFilter:			DBSCAN clustering and filter the noises points for SegMatch next step

19.LocTest:				Test of localization on the result map
