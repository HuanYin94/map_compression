# To learn what is useful in a 3D map

1. mapAccuLaser: 	accumalte laser-based experience map

2. mapCheck: 		just show the map

3. mapCutter:		cut the wholemap to two parts: train & test

4. mapFeater: 		extract the feature of each 3D point // not used

5. mapAccuLaserMultiple: 	accumalte laser-based experience map, with no-limit Maxsession

6. mapSessioner: 	adjust the session descriptor of some points, data preprocessing, not used

7. mapAccuLaserRange:		accumalte laser-based experience map, consider the range distance

8. labelLaser:		label the points with session in a laser Frame according the map_session_cnt // not used

9. sessionFilter:	make great session be salient! & brother_cnt to filter some lonely ones //salient GET

10.generateSlidingSamples:	generate samples by Sliding Window for further segmentation

11.generateCRFFeatures:		generate node features of each point node, 500000

11.savePointNetFeatures:	save Points&Labels for PointNet Training

11.savePointNetBinsFeatures:save Points&Labels for PointNet Training, add Bins 

12.saveAllCRFFeatures:		save all features for simple classification

13.randomSampleMap:			random sampling the map for comparison

14.loadFinalResults:		load the detection results

15.mapAccuLaser:			???

16.mapCutterTraj: 	cut the wholemap to two parts: train & test, according to the poses attached

17.errorDistribution:		save the NN matched distance between the salient points and salient results

18.DBSCANFilter:			DBSCAN clustering and filter the noises points for SegMatch next step
