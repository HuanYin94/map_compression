# To learn what is useful in a 3D map

mapCheck: 		just show the map

mapCompresser:		compress the map according to the saliency descriptor

sessionFilter:	make great session be salient! & brother_cnt to filter some lonely ones //salient GET

saveAllCRFFeatures:		save all features for simple classification

randomSampleMap:			random sampling the map for comparison

loadFinalResults:		load the detection results

mapCutterTraj: 	cut the wholemap to two parts: train & test, according to the poses attached

errorDistribution:		save the NN matched distance between the salient points and salient results

DBSCANFilter:			DBSCAN clustering and filter the noises points for SegMatch next step

LocTest:				Test of localization on the result map

mapAccuLaser: 		accumalte laser-based experience map, obseration-maximum limited

mapAccuLaserRange:		accumalte laser-based experience map, consider the velocity of the robotcar, to decide the range

mapComapre:				To compare the salient index and delta-distance of two experienced map cloud

mapSummer:				Sum two map Cloud with salient descriptors and save tit

mapScoringIndex:      accumalte laser-based experience map, range limited, new one for Quardratic Programmingï¼Ÿ

matchOut:      			get the matched count by aligning point clouds using ground truth poses, 1-1 for velodyne cloud

genVisMatrix:         generate the rows of visibility matrix A by aligning, k-search for map points

loadProResult:       load the predicted programming results from files and save cloud
